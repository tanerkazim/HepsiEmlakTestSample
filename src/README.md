
## Happy Path Automation Project for hepsiemlak.com

---

### Things that I used:
* Selenium
* JUnit
* WebDriver Manager
---
#### Notes:
- I used _bonigarcia webdrivermanager_ for automatically detect Chrome version and download required driver version,
  so you don't need to configure webdriver manually
- All dependencies already defined in the pom.xml file so It will be enough to run it as Maven build
- Compiler JDK source/target level 17
